# Leap Year Checker

This Python program checks if a given year is a leap year within the Gregorian calendar period. Here's how it determines whether a year is a leap year:

- If the year is less than 1582, it is not within the Gregorian calendar period, and the program displays the message "Not within the Gregorian calendar period".
- If the year is not divisible by 4, or it is divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400, it is considered a common year.
- If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or it is divisible by both 100 and 400, it is considered a leap year.

## Usage

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter a year when prompted.
3. The program will check if the year is a leap year or a common year and display the corresponding message.

## Example

Enter a year: 2000
This is a leap year

Enter a year: 1700
This is a common year

Enter a year: 1500
Not within the Gregorian calendar period

Feel free to use this program to check if a given year is a leap year within the Gregorian calendar period.
